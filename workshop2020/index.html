                  <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid realms pioneered 
                        study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises from that era 
                        together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and documentary texts 
                        from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity 
                        was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between scholars affiliated with many 
                        different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others. Sometimes this 
                        exchange occurred through books or letters, other times face-to-face in formal, institutional settings, side-by-side 
                        in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, family members, or patrons. 
                    </p>
      
                    <p>In the framework of the project "Communities of Knowledge" (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                    and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of person-to-person knowledge exchange
                    among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Format and Date</h3>
                    <p>If your abstract is accepted, we'll contact you to set up a date and time that works with 
                        your schedule. Most sessions will be held in late October to early November. A preliminary 
                        draft of your paper for discussion will be uploaded 1–2 weeks before your session to an 
                        area where registered participants can read it and ask questions or make comments. During the 
                        live session, you'll present a very brief sketch of your results (lightning-talk style), 
                        followed by short responses from 1–2 invited participants, and general discussion.
