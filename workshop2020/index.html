                  <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid realms pioneered 
                        study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises from that era 
                        together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and documentary texts 
                        from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity 
                        was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between scholars affiliated with many 
                        different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others. Sometimes this 
                        exchange occurred through books or letters while at other times it was face-to-face in formal, institutional settings, side-by-side 
                        in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, or family members. 
                    </p>
      
                    <p>In the framework of the project "<a href="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge</a>" (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                    and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of person-to-person knowledge exchange
                    among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <b>keynote</b> session will feature <b>Dr. Ignacio Sánchez</b> (University of Warwick), whose recent contributions to the field include helping to prepare a brand new edition and translation of Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, <a href="https://dh.brill.com/scholarlyeditions/library/urn:cts:arabicLit:0668IbnAbiUsaibia/"><i>The Best Accounts of the Classes of Physicians</i></a> (Leiden: Brill, 2020).</p>

                    <h3>Format and Date</h3>
                    <p>The series is open to two types of submissions: <b>research papers</b> and <b>project demos</b>.</p>
                    <h4>1. Research Paper Submissions</h4>
                    <p>We'll contact authors of accepted abstracts to set up a date and time that works with 
                        your schedule. Sessions will be held in the late fall (October to December). A preliminary 
                        draft of your paper for discussion will be uploaded 1–2 weeks before your session to an 
                        area where registered participants can read it and ask questions or make comments. During the 
                        live session, you'll present a very brief sketch of your results (lightning-talk style), 
                        followed by short responses from 1–2 invited participants, and an extended general discussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Revised papers will be submitted in 2021 to <b>a special issue of <a href="http://www.medievalworlds.net"><i>medieval worlds: comparative &amp; interdisciplinary studies</i></a></b>, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ISSN 2412-3196). Per the journal guidelines, research articles should be 5,000–10,000 words.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Project Demos</h4>
                    <p>Accepted project demos will be scheduled according to the author's convenience and included as brief presentations during one of the relevant live discussions. Project demos will also be submitted as short articles (2,000–5,000 words) to the workshop's special issue of <a href="http://www.medievalworlds.net"><i>medieval worlds: comparative &amp; interdisciplinary studies</i></a>.</p>
