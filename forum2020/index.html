                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>The virtual forum is conceived as an opportunity to discuss the state of research on
                        interreligious knowledge exchange. Half-hour <strong>project demos</strong> will showcase
                        ongoing projects in the area, while one-hour <strong>research paper discussions</strong> are a
                        chance to interact on a deeper level with researchers who are in the process of formulating
                        approaches to the subject.</p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid and
                        neighboring realms
                        pioneered
                        study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises
                        from that era
                        together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and
                        documentary texts
                        from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity
                        was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between
                        scholars affiliated with many
                        different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others.
                        Sometimes this
                        exchange occurred through books or letters while at other times it was face-to-face in formal,
                        institutional settings, side-by-side
                        in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, or family members.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the framework of the project "<a href="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge</a>"
                        (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                        and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of
                        person-to-person knowledge exchange
                        among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.

                                <p>The project “Communities of Knowledge: Interreligious Networks of Scholars in Ibn Abī
                                    Uṣaybiʿa’s <i>History of the Physicians</i>” aims to examine the social encounters
                                    of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish scholars in the Abbasid Near East, broadly defined
                                    as 750–1258. While the <em>fact</em> of exchange between scholars of many different
                                    communities during this period is well established, and their accomplishments are
                                    well known, the <em>ways</em> in which this exchange occurred are not as well
                                    researched. Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa’s (1203–1270 AD) biographical dictionary provides rich
                                    information about such interactions, which sometimes occurred directly between
                                    scholars, but other times involved much larger networks of people, including
                                    patrons, patients, family members, rulers, and slaves.</p>
                                <div id='collapse-1' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>The project asks, in general, how Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa depicts these networks, as
                                        well as, more specifically, which people, places, and types of communication
                                        were involved in them. This project demo will explain the different stages of
                                        this analysis. First, we identify and “tag” people and places in the source
                                        text. Next, we use these tags to create prosopographical nuggets called
                                        “factoids,” which encapsulate many different assertions throughout the text
                                        about the people involved and form the basis for mapping their relationships as
                                        a network. Finally, we analyze these networks, using quantitative metrics to
                                        focus our attention on the persons, places, or features in the network that call
                                        for in-depth qualitative study. We anticipate—and our preliminary results
                                        suggest—that this process will bring to light specific but underappreciated
                                        aspects of interreligious exchange.</p>

                                <p>The Buyid Muʿtazilite vizier Ibn ʿAbbād (d. 385/995) famously referred to medicine as
                                    ‘a
                                    ladder of heresy’ (<i>sullam al-ilḥād</i>). This statement reflects the opinions of
                                    a
                                    number of Muʿtazilite theologians who, already since the 9th century, polemicised
                                    against medicine. These critiques were focused on the epistemological status of a
                                    discipline mainly concerned with particulars (<i>juzʾiyyāt</i>), and on the
                                    challenge
                                    that the Hippocratic-Galenic theories posed for the debates on creation, causation
                                    and
                                    God’s omnipotence. These theologians did not target a particular religious group but
                                    rather those scholars who departed from the consensus about God’s design, Muslims
                                    and
                                    non-Muslims alike, most especially the group referred to as <i>Dahriyya</i>
                                    (Eternalists).</p>
                                <div id='collapse-2' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>The suspicion of unbelief –and the shadow of the <i>Dahriyya</i>– never abandoned
                                        physicians, but the critique against medicine eventually become a critique of
                                        <i>dhimmī</i>s. Medicine had been almost monopolised by Sabians and Christians
                                        under
                                        the early Abbasids and the Ayyubids, and was largely practiced by Jews in the
                                        Fatimid and Mamluk periods. From the 12th/13th century onwards, however, we
                                        witness
                                        an increasing concern about the confession of physicians that led to the
                                        islamisation of this field with the promotion of Muslim medical practitioners
                                        and
                                        the emergence of the so-called prophetic medicine (<i>ṭibb nabawī</i>).</p>
                                    <p>Regretfully, Ibn Abī Uṣaybʿia is almost completely silent about all these
                                        questions.
                                        This ‘Islamisation of medicine’ is perceivable in the increase of Muslim
                                        physicians
                                        and the references to conversions that appear in the 13th c. biographies of the
                                        <i>ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ</i>, but the physician portrayed by this author is a rather
                                        idealised image, untainted by these petty polemics. </p>
                                    <p>In this paper I will survey a number of sources that offer a rather different
                                        glimpse
                                        of the role of medicine and <i>dhimmī</i> physicians in pre-Modern Islam. I
                                        shall be
                                        looking at the way theologians attacked medicine and how it was defended by both
                                        Muslim and non-Muslim physicians, sometimes with very similar arguments. I will
                                        argue that these polemics cannot be simply subsumed into the dichotomy
                                        Islamic/non-Islamic sciences, nor reduced to a clash between Muslim and
                                        non-Muslims.

                                <p>The Zoroastrian priesthood was greatly diminished over the centuries after the Arab
                                    conquest, and its traditions so scattered that only a fragment of the Zoroastrian
                                    knowledge that had once existed still remained by this time. Yet despite the gap
                                    between
                                    these priests and the end of the Sasanian kingdom, this corpus of texts is taken to
                                    be
                                    the product of a continuous tradition of priestly transmission. This paper questions
                                    standard narratives of Zoroastrian history, textual transmission, and priestly
                                    genealogy
                                    by looking at Zoroastrian priests in Arabic sources of the ninth through eleventh
                                    centuries alongside contemporary Middle Persian texts. </p>

                                    <p>These references span authors, genres, and centuries of Arabic literature,
                                        appearing
                                        in histories, geographies, adab works, heresiographies, ṭabaqāt literature, and
                                        more. These texts cite the Zoroastrian priests of the ʿAbbāsid era
                                        (<i>al-mawbaḏ</i>
                                        in Arabic) as authors of books, informants on topics of Persian religious or
                                        cultural significance, sages attributed with wise or clever sayings, advisors to
                                        kings and caliphs, and participants in religious debates in the court of the
                                        caliphs. When we look outside the extant corpus of Zoroastrian texts, we find
                                        that
                                        there were mobeds active in the wider intellectual circles and operating under

                                        living under Islamic rule; and it is not clear to what extent they communicated

                                <p>Many different scholarly communities participated in the diffusion of the Indo-Arabic
                                    numerical system from India to Iraq and thence to the African littoral and to Spain.
                                    This positional decimal numeral system is the most common symbolic system today for
                                    the
                                    representation of numbers, and was invented by Indian mathematicians between the 1st
                                    and
                                    4th centuries. It reached Baghdad from Persia by 732 A.D., and from there spread to
                                    the
                                    eastern Mediterranean. </p>
                                <div id='collapse-4' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>Much of this diffusion was carried out by Roman trading vessels moving down the
                                        Red
                                        Sea from Alexandria to cross the Indian Ocean to trade precious metals for
                                        Indian
                                        spices. In turn Indian trading vessels made the voyage to Alexandria. After the
                                        fall
                                        of Egypt in 31 AD to the Roman Empire of Augustus, this trade was accelerated,
                                        including over 120 large vessels a year sailing down the Red Sea for Indian and
                                        Sri
                                        Lankan ports. In this paper, we will note several key features of this trade.
                                        First,
                                        this enormously large spice trade supported Roman military activity for
                                        centuries by
                                        means of a value tax at the borders of 25%. Control of Egypt was crucial to this
                                        tax. Second, movement of the trade fleets from the Red Sea and returning was
                                        based
                                        on a careful understanding of seasonal monsoon activity for propulsion. This
                                        predictable wind propulsion allowed 6 knots per hour or better. Third, borrowing
                                        of
                                        numerical systems by Arabic traders while working in India was common but not
                                        systematic, as India hosted a multitude of different numerical systems using a
                                        different number of digits. Limiting the number of digits to ten as the
                                        Indo-Arabic
                                        system diffused across the Mediterranean Sea was the last major innovation of
                                        the
                                        spread of this system and its three variant glyphs. </p>

                                <p>This paper is focused on the study of an unpublished palimpsest fragment from the
                                    <i>Qubbat al-khazna</i> in Damascus, which presents a very interesting structure.
                                    The
                                    Greek <i>scriptio inferior</i>, already identified as a biblical text, coexists with
                                    the
                                    Arabic <i>scriptio superior</i> − referred to an Islamic text − which has not been
                                    properly studied in its textual and paleographical features so far. The Arabic text
                                    is
                                    an excerpt belonging to the medical-botanical work entitled <i>Mukhtaṣar
                                        fī-l-ṭibb</i>
                                    (“Compendium of Medicine”) − known from only one manuscript witness so far − written
                                    by
                                    the Andalusian jurist ‛Abd al-Malik b. Ḥabīb (d. 238 AH/AD 853). </p>

                                    <p>The textual examination of the Arabic text will be conducted along with the
                                        paleographical and codicological analysis of the fragment, in order to suggest
                                        some
                                        hypotheses about its dating and provenance. Such a multidisciplinary research
                                        represents a starting point from which some thoughts, referred to the Arabic
                                        <i>scriptio superior</i> in the first place, has been carried out. For example,
                                        the
                                        study of the Arabic text − which testifies a high degree of knowledge in the
                                        fields
                                        of botany and medicine − along with the palimpsest order of the fragment, has
                                        suggested a monastic environment as its probable place of origin. Furthermore,
                                        the
                                        fragment represents a documentary witness which highlights the relevance of the
                                        body
                                        care, as attributed in such environment, in addition to the peculiar process of
                                        the
                                        discard of a religious text − the Bible in Greek − apparently sensed as no more
                                        useful, in a context arguably yet arabized. More interestingly, it is a clear
                                        evidence of the fact that such a vision of life was pursued acquiring ideas and
                                        concepts, also derived from different cultures − even if it would have implied
                                        the
                                        study and the use of an Islamic text, written in the Arabic script.</p>

                                    has
                                    attracted the attention of many distinguished scholars over the last century and a
                                    half.
                                    The research history of this significant document is almost as intriguing as the

                                    <p>In my presentation, I will briefly summarise the research history to illustrate
                                        how
                                        historiography is prone to be (mis-)guided by cultural predispositions and
                                        shaped by
                                        issues, concerns, and blind spots rooted in the historian’s realm of experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The commentary by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Ṭaybughā was the result of a
                                        longstanding friendship with Rabbi David ben Yehoshuʿa, the grandson of
                                        Maimonides’
                                        great-grandson. The impact of this friendship comes to the fore on several
                                        occasions
                                        in David’s own commentary on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. In David’s view, this
                                        friendship represented far more than a mere social acquaintance with a Muslim
                                        soulmate. Like his illustrious ancestor, he conceived of the Foundational Laws
                                        of
                                        the Torah as a straightforward, ‘exoteric’ digest of all theoretical sciences,
                                        in
                                        such a way that a well-conceived commentary upon these chapters should build
                                        upon
                                        the most advanced scientific knowledge available at a given time. The perfect
                                        commentator should therefore be a leading scientist of his time, irrespective of
                                        his

                                <p>Barhebraeus, the great Syrian Orthodox polymath and theologian (1226-1286), treats
                                    animals’ abilities to sleep and dream in his inedited <i>Book on Animals</i> of his
                                    philosophical <i>summa Cream of Wisdom</i>, a book that draws heavily on Avicenna,
                                    though also on Aristotle.</p>
                                <p>In comparison with his sources, however, he might be understood as allowing for more
                                    animals to have the ability to dream than Aristotle initially did, even though using
                                    Aristotle’s animal examples for viviparous quadrupeds, the primary group of animals
                                    able
                                    to dream for Aristotle.</p>
                                <div id='collapse-7' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>The paper will, firstly, address the question which groups of animals are
                                        considered
                                        as being able to dream according to Aristotle, Avicenna, Barhebraeus, Albert the
                                        Great in the Latin West, who was also in particular influenced by Avicenna, as
                                        well
                                        as the Iraqi zoologist Ibn Abī al-Ashʿath, who stood more in the Galenic than
                                        Aristotelian tradition, and point to changes and ask whether these changes were
                                        intentional or just due to paraphrasing a given source.</p>
                                    <p>Secondly, the paper will address the question which sources Barhebraeus had at
                                        his
                                        disposal and where. Though witnessing the very end of the Abbasid era, he still
                                        benefitted from translations begun during the early Abbasids. Especially the
                                        early
                                        combined Arabic transmission of three Aristotelian zoological works still had an
                                        impact on his Syriac <i>Book on Animals</i>.</p>
                                    <p>Thirdly, the question of collaborating with other scholars shall be addressed,
                                        though
                                        this has to be done <i>ex negativo</i> for the composition of the
                                        <i>Animals</i>.
                                        While Barhebraeus is assumed to have met, for example, the Muslim scholar Naṣīr
                                        al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī in person at the Maragha observatory and academy, which had an
                                        influence on his astronomical works, and also a personal acquaintance with Ibn
                                        Kammūna, a philosopher of Jewish descent, has recently been assumed by Roggema
                                        regarding theological texts, this form of cooperation surprisingly doesn’t seem
                                        to
                                        be the case for his biological works, where he primarily relies on Aristotle and
                                        Avicenna. The paper will look into the reasons for that and argue tentatively
                                        that
                                        this assumed lack of a manifestation of a knowledge transfer by personal
                                        exchange in
                                        his biological works, in contrast to other works by him, might here be due to a
                                        neglect of zoological topics or a changed curriculum in post-classical Islamic
                                        philosophy, and that this lack of contemporary or at least post-Avicennan
                                        available
                                        texts led him to take recourse to Aristotle and Avicenna instead.</p>

                                <p>The early ʻAbbasid epoch was famous for adaptation of Greek science through the
                                    intellectual work of Syrian scholars. The Nestorian center of learning and
                                    intellectual
                                    work, the monastery Dayr Qunnā near Baghdad had a special patronage. In the ʻAbbasid
                                    epoch this center trained personnel for the state administration. The most eminent
                                    figure in Islamic tradition, who probably was influenced by Dayr Qunna, was the
                                    eminent
                                    Baghdad Sufi master al-Ḥallāj. Some researchers even found him to be a hidden
                                    Christian.
                                </p>
                                <div id='collapse-8' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>Really some points of al-Ḥallāj’s teaching about divine love, annihilation of the
                                        human spirit in God and incarnation (<i>ḥulūl</i>) of the divine nature
                                        (<i>lāhūt</i>) in the human nature (<i>nāsūt</i>), and unity with God
                                        (<i>ittiḥād</i>) have clear parallels with Syrian Christianity. His cosmological
                                        doctrine has a number of parallels with ideas of pseudo-Empedocles that gained
                                        popularity in Syrian monasteries. The crucial points of al-Ḥallāj’s cosmology
                                        were
                                        promoted by Abū ’l-Ḥasan ʻAlī al-Daylamī in the <i>Kitāb ʿaṭf al-alif al-maʾlūf
                                            ʿalā
                                            l-lām al-maʿṭūf</i>. Al-Daylamī was a disciple of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī and
                                        belonged to the tradition that cultivated the cosmological ideas of
                                        pseudo-Empedocles. In the ʿAbbasid epoch this tradition comes from Dayr Qunnā.
                                        The
                                        <i>Commentary</i> on Aristotle's Metaphysics written by Mattā b. Yūnus, the
                                        eminent
                                        representative of the local scientific tradition shows this tendency. We can
                                        reconstruct the crucial points of the Arab partisans of pseudo-Empedocles
                                        according
                                        to several texts of al-Shahrastānī, Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, al-Daylamī and
                                        al-Ḥallāj.
                                        For example, the presence of five emanations and four elements which are moved
                                        by
                                        love and hostility, and passionate love as the most important divine attribute.
                                        The
                                        <i>materia prima</i> appeared through this attribute. </p>

                                <p>Library records and manuscript catalogues are fundamental sources for historians,
                                    nevertheless, researchers are aware that a ​transmission process is determined by

                                    the extant manuscripts as well as by a great number of texts which were lost in
                                    time.
                                    Historians of German literature claim that for every preserved work there are
                                    thousands
                                    of lost ones. While it is difficult to appreciate the number of lost sources, it is

                                <p>Ibn al-Nadīm’s <i>Fihrist</i> is a major primary source for Abbasid intellectual
                                    history.
                                    Although its importance for the field has been acknowledged since its first edition
                                    at
                                    the end of the 19th century, the studies dealing with this encyclopaedic work as a
                                    whole
                                    are remarkably rare, since its material has been mostly used by researchers looking
                                    for
                                    biographic details regarding specific scholars of the Islamic Middle Ages.</p>
                                <p> </p>

                                    <p>Our intent is to approach the Fihrist as a coherent totality, taking into account
                                        the
                                        overarching structure of the text and the repeating patterns from one section to
                                        another, and to assess its treatment of interreligious scholarly collaboration
                                        through a systematic survey of the relevant instances. Since Ibn al-Nadīm (d.
                                        330/990) gathered pieces of information about a wide range of scholars, it is
                                        very
                                        interesting to examine the ways in which he depicts the cases of interaction –
                                        and
                                        sometimes conflict – between Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars. It is
                                        particularly important when it comes to specialists of rational sciences, as it
                                        is
                                        well-known that certain fields such as medicine, astronomy and philosophy
                                        involved
                                        scholars from different religious backgrounds in Abbasid and Buyid centres of
                                        knowledge, especially in the context of translation activities.</p>
                                    <p> Three main lines of inquiry will guide our presentation. First, the forms, times
                                        and
                                        places of interreligious exchanges in the <i>Fihrist</i>. Then, the position of the
                                        author
                                        regarding this phenomenon: does he explicitly acknowledge it or does he merely
                                        mention it without labelling it? Lastly, since these collaborations mainly
                                        appear in
                                        the context of anecdotes, how can we interpret these narratives, and use them to
                                        improve our understanding of the social and religious dynamics of the Abbasid
                                        scholarly milieu? Our hope is that by focusing on the general structure of this
                                        work, we will shed a new light on the problematic of interreligious
                                        collaboration in
                                        the Abbasid society, as well as lay the ground for drawing parallels with Ibn
                                        Abī
                                        Uṣaybiʿa’s <i>ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ</i> in that respect.</p>

                                <p>Islamic medicine certainly inherited a refined tradition from Greek medicine, but
                                    also
                                    has seen an important shift in medical training. First, the structures radically
                                    changed: they went from an era where medicine passed on from father to son, or where
                                    being the disciple of a master was very much like becoming part of his family—to an
                                    era where several types of medical training coexisted: from father to son, by
                                    teaching
                                    oneself (viz. by reading handbooks) or by resorting to the master through classes in
                                    hospitals or medical schools. </p>
                                <div id='collapse-12' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>Obviously, the first two ways must be taken into consideration for approaching
                                        properly how the sources spread into the Arabic world and how they were handled
                                        by
                                        scholars, many of them were travellers and collectors of books. Nevertheless,
                                        the
                                        latter, to which one must add discussions between trained physicians, gives us a
                                        lively and vivid insight into the way Arabic medicine evolved through debates
                                        between prominent figures.</p>
                                    <p>In this respect, in connection with the transmission of medical art and the
                                        handbooks, of great interest are the issues related to the religious affiliation
                                        of
                                        the physicians, either Christians, Jews or Muslims, at the turning point between
                                        the
                                        Ayyūbid and the Mamlūk eras (in the XIII<sup>th</sup> century AD) between
                                        Damascus
                                        and Cairo, for they all did refer to Greek sources, but in different ways. On
                                        this
                                        account, of particular interest are the literary patterns that are used to put
                                        on
                                        stage these controversies as they may rely on traditions already found centuries
                                        ago, in authors such as al-Jāḥiẓ or al-Tawḥīdī.</p>
                                    <p>We will try to explore the most significant examples provided by Ibn Abī
                                        Uṣaybiʿah,
                                        some of which deal with teaching, others with research, showing active
                                        discussions
                                        between physicians, regardless of religion, facilitated by the sultan himself
                                        who
                                        provided a special place at his residence to be used as a <i>majlis</i> for
                                        research. Surely, depending on whether they were Muslims, Jews or Christians,
                                        the
                                        social positions they held were different, but also complementary as they had
                                        different access to the sources. Even the most prominent Muslim physicians had
                                        to
                                        rely on colleagues who could recall Galenic sources word for word. This point
                                        explains to a large extent the faithfulness of the text preserved in Ibn Abī
                                        Uṣaybiʿah to the Greek sources.</p>

                                <p>Timothy I (ca. 740-823 CE/AH 122-208) was <i>katholikos</i> of the Church of the East
                                    for
                                    more than forty years between the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th
                                    century
                                    (ca. 780-823/AH 164-208). During this time, he moved the seat of the patriarchate to
                                    Baghdad, where he entertained close relationships with the Abbasid court. A number
                                    of
                                    his surviving letters, written in Syriac, attest to this. In particular, two
                                    letter-treatises of considerable length relate encounters Timothy had with a Muslim
                                    Aristotelian philosopher (letter 40) and with caliph Al-Mahdi himself (letter 59).
                                </p>
                                <div id='collapse-13' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>These letters document an intense theological debate that took place between
                                        Christians and Muslims at the court, one that used Aristotelian logic as a sort
                                        of
                                        shared language in order to discuss urgent religious and philosophical matters.
                                        While scholars have paid much attention to this material, there remains to be
                                        studied how Timothy modulated his explanations according to the intended
                                        audience.
                                        My paper aims to analyse how Timothy managed to express his beliefs in different
                                        ways depending on different occasions. Far from being a faithful reflection of
                                        the
                                        dialogues that took place at the caliph’s court, I maintain that Timothy’s
                                        letters
                                        are carefully planned literary products that served a double purpose. On the one
                                        hand, they conveyed a climate of peaceful and productive exchange with Muslim
                                        scholars and sovereigns, but on the other, they played the crucial role of
                                        providing
                                        other Christians with a ready-made set of answers to some of the thorniest
                                        questions
                                        and objections that their Muslim counterparts could pose to them. By extending
                                        the
                                        view to those letters (esp. 34-6) that were aimed solely at an internal,
                                        Christian
                                        audience, I will show how this process of reader-oriented variation occurred and
                                        I
                                        will attempt to reconstruct Timothy’s preoccupations as Head of the eastern

                                <p>The paper analyzes theological texts by Patriarch Timothy I (letters 40 and 59) and
                                    Nonnus of Nisibis (“The Apologetic Treatise”) written in Syriac during the 8th and
                                    9th
                                    centuries. These Christian authors aimed to defend their Christian faith against
                                    Muslim
                                    objections against Christianity. In doing so, Timothy and Nonnus seemed to be well
                                    aware
                                    of the Islamic theology of their period. The paper compares Timothy’s and Nonnus’
                                    reasoning to defend the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and Christology with
                                    contemporary Muslim (especially Muʿtazilite) thought. </p>

                                    <p>Although the textual material of the Muʿtazilite thinkers from the 8th and 9th
                                        centuries which has come down to us is rather scanty, it is possible to identify
                                        references to certain Muʿtazilite thinkers or to particular Muslim doctrines in
                                        the
                                        texts written by Timothy and Nonnus. The paper outlines these references to
                                        contemporary Muslim thought in more detail than previous research has done.
                                        Thus, it
                                        demonstrates that Christians and Muslims were not just religious counterparts

                                        the ʿAbbāsid period. Instead, even religious disputation texts show that its
                                        Christian authors had an intimate knowledge of the Muslim theology of their

                                        and must have been in close contact with their Muslim colleagues.</p>

                                    gain dominance of this vast, ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse area
                                    which had its own, long imperial traditions, and to make this a sustainable

                                        together, from the Nile Delta to the Hindu Kush. We approach this broad question

                                    <p>The project studies the mechanics of Islamic rule through three main areas: the
                                        language of social dependency expressed, in particular, in letters of request;
                                        the
                                        relationship between central and provincial governorship; and the role of local
                                        elites as well as actors at the fringes of government, such as religious
                                        scholars,
                                        among others. Our research is comparative, as it embraces local realities in
                                        different regions and looks at a variety of groups, not to mention sources in
                                        several languages and scripts; attentive to trends and trajectories, as it
                                        covers
                                        over three centuries; and innovative, as it is based on most recent findings in
                                        papyrology and archaeology, combining them with new perspectives in Middle East

                                        leadership and political governance. Ed Hayes' research focuses on the history

                                        early Imami Shi'i communities and on the relationship between fiscal policy and
                                        religious protest. Cecilia Palombo's research, on the other hand, looks at the
                                        development of localized forms of Islamic governance through the involvement of
                                        Christian religious leaders, such as monastic headmen.</p>

                                <p>The term <i>ḥanpā</i> (pl. <i>ḥanpē</i>), Syriac ‘pagan,’ was used by Syriac
                                    Christian
                                    scholars to denote a variety of non-Christian religious communities and was one of
                                    the
                                    first Syriac terms used to refer to Muslims. While other Syriac terms came into use
                                    to
                                    denote Muslims over the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, C.E.,
                                    <i>ḥanpā</i>
                                    remained common well into the ʿAbbasid period, especially in legal writing. This
                                    paper
                                    focuses on the use of <i>ḥanpā</i>/<i>ḥanpē</i> in Syriac Christian legal writing in
                                    the
                                    early ʿAbbasid period to signify Muslims. </p>

                                    <p>In this paper, I argue that, when used in Syriac Christian legal texts, the term
                                        <i>ḥanpā</i> should be viewed as a legal category, one that very much included
                                        Muslims. In this context, a <i>ḥanpā</i> is essentially an outsider who may
                                        still
                                        interact with Syriac Christian individuals and communities, but in an
                                        increasingly
                                        regulated way that is meant to protect Syriac Christian communities from loss of
                                        constituents (presumably to conversion to Islam) or the blurring of boundaries
                                        between Muslim and Christian beliefs and practices. For example, marrying one’s
                                        daughter to a pagan was condemned in the canons of George I of Antioch (d. 790
                                        C.E.), and marrying a daughter to a <i>ḥanpā</i> barred father and daughter from
                                        entering the church. It is clear this ruling included Muslim men, or perhaps was
                                        specifically meant for them. In contrast, earlier Syriac Christian leaders such
                                        as
                                        Jacob of Edessa (d. 708 C.E.) allowed Christian women who married Muslim men to
                                        continue taking communion, on grounds that not allowing them to do so would
                                        encourage conversion to Islam. Use of <i>ḥanpā</i> to describe Muslims in the
                                        early
                                        ʿAbbasid era suggests an attempt to regulate interactions with Muslims, with a
                                        particular emphasis on marriage, conversion, and social interactions.</p>

                                    in the extent to which it details the social interactions of scholars from many
                                    different religious communities. <i>Ṭabaqāt</i> literature in general tends to
                                    provide a kind of Who’s-Who resource collecting information about personages in
                                    particular categories, such as hadith transmitters or poets. Normally authors tended
                                    to make these categories applicable to a certain religious tradition, but Ibn Abī
                                    Uṣaybiʿa’s project broke the mold by outlining a profession (medicine and related
                                    areas) in which collaboration and exchange among communities was typical. The
                                    <i>History of Physicians</i> is thus an ideal target for large-scale analysis of
                                    interreligious exchange, as the project “Communities of Knowledge” is in the process
                                    of doing.

                                    <p>Nevertheless, incorporating “religious affiliation” as a factor in analyzing Ibn
                                        Abī Uṣaybiʿa’s text is fraught with complexity. First is the looming issue of
                                        what religion even means in this context. Second is the question of which terms
                                        or phrases the author uses to intentionally signal a particular affiliation.
                                        Third, which other characteristics may be taken to indicate religious
                                        affiliation, as perhaps certain titles, professions, actions, or (very
                                        cautiously) names? Finally, what should be done with mixed indications, whether
                                        these are due to inaccurate sources, ambiguous affiliation, or conversion?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I will present a case for recording these textual indications using the
                                        prosopographical tool of “factoids,” which can support a more nuanced analysis
                                        than simply recording a single affiliation for each person. Each factoid,
                                        representing an assertion by Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa or his sources, is one of several
                                        markers of religious affiliation, which may point toward different affiliations
                                        for the same person. The strength of these markers and their agreement or
                                        variance for a particular person provide specific data points that can be used
                                        to reconstruct networks of communities while also allowing for alternate
                                        scenarios.

                                <p>The medieval Middle East, at the crossroads of Africa and Eurasia, included more
                                    distinct yet intersecting literary traditions in more languages than any other part
                                    of the premodern world. While several of these literary traditions were religiously
                                    demarcated, others such as Arabic and Persian were multi-religious written cultures.
                                    Despite this, the religious diversity of this region is often conceptualized as
                                    separate communities who sometimes interacted. Religion was certainly a socially
                                    relevant category employed by medieval people to organize their world, and yet
                                    people from every religion wrote about the same government, the same society, and
                                    largely the same culture as expressed in religious multiplicity.</p>

                                        demonstrate the shared culture and society of the diverse medieval Middle East.
                                        It will provide a union index to selected primary sources in Arabic, Armenian,

                                        practices mentioned in each literary tradition. The result is that someone
