                            <p>The Buyid Muʿtazilite vizier Ibn ʿAbbād (d. 385/995) famously referred to medicine as ‘a
                                ladder of heresy’ (sullam al-ilḥād). This statement reflects the opinions of a number of
                                Muʿtazilite theologians who, already since the 9th century, polemicised against
                                medicine. These critiques were focused on the epistemological status of a discipline
                                mainly concerned with particulars (juzʾiyyāt), and on the challenge that the
                                Hippocratic-Galenic theories posed for the debates on creation, causation and God’s
                                omnipotence. These theologians did not target a particular religious group but rather
                                those scholars who departed from the consensus about God’s design, Muslims and
                                non-Muslims alike, most especially the group referred to as Dahriyya (Eternalists).

                            <div id="collapse-2" class="collapse">
                                <p>
                                    The suspicion of unbelief –and the shadow of the Dahriyya– never abandoned
                                    physicians, but the critique against medicine eventually become a critique of
                                    dhimmīs. Medicine had been almost monopolised by Sabians and Christians under the
                                    early Abbasids and the Ayyubids, and was largely practiced by Jews in the Fatimid
                                    and Mamluk periods. From the 12th/13th century onwards, however, we witness an
                                    increasing concern about the confession of physicians that led to the islamisation
                                    of this field with the promotion of Muslim medical practitioners and the emergence
                                    of the so-called prophetic medicine (ṭibb nabawī).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regretfully, Ibn Abī Uṣaybʿia is almost completely silent about all these questions.
                                    This ‘Islamisation of medicine’ is perceivable in the increase of Muslim physicians
                                    and the references to conversions that appear in the 13th c. biographies of the
                                    ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ, but the physician portrayed by this author is a rather idealised
                                    image, untainted by these petty polemics.
                                </p>

                                    In this paper I will survey a number of sources that offer a rather different
                                    glimpse of the role of medicine and dhimmī physicians in pre-Modern Islam. I shall
                                    be looking at the way theologians attacked medicine and how it was defended by both
                                    Muslim and non-Muslim physicians, sometimes with very similar arguments. I will
                                    argue that these polemics cannot be simply subsumed into the dichotomy
                                    Islamic/non-Islamic sciences, nor reduced to a clash between Muslim and
                                    non-Muslims."</p>

                    The Zoroastrian priesthood was greatly diminished over the centuries after the Arab conquest, and
                    its traditions so scattered that only a fragment of the Zoroastrian knowledge that had once existed
                    still remained by this the ninth century. Yet despite the gap between the Islamic-era priests
                    (mobeds) and the end of the Sasanian kingdom, this corpus of texts is taken to be the product of a
                    continuous tradition of priestly transmission. This paper questions standard narratives of
                    Zoroastrian history, textual transmission, and priestly genealogy by looking at Zoroastrian priests
                    in Arabic sources of the ninth and tenth centuries alongside contemporary Middle Persian texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These references span authors, genres, and centuries of Arabic literature. They appear in
                        histories, geographies, adab works, heresiographies, ṭabaqāt literature, and, of course, Ibn
                        al-Nadīm’s Fihrist. These texts cite the Zoroastrian priests of the ʿAbbāsid era (usually
                        al-mawbaḏ in Arabic) as authors of books, informants on topics of Persian religious or cultural
                        significance, sages attributed with wise or clever sayings, advisors to kings and caliphs, and
                        participants in religious debates in the court of the caliph or his vizier. Sometimes the
                        reference is to a named individual—and in a few instances this name is corroborated by
                        Zoroastrian texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were evidently more mobeds than previously assumed from Zoroastrian texts alone, and they
                        were active in the wider intellectual circles and operating under the patronage of Muslim
                        rulers. There were multiple communities of Zoroastrians living under Islamic rule, and it is not
                        clear to what extent they communicated with each other or followed similar practices. Arabic
                        sources from the period can shed light on where and when these communities thrived, what groups
                        and individuals were considered authoritative in the wider Zoroastrian community, and what
                        regional variety there might also have been—rather than assuming a narrative of orthodox
                        transmission.

                    <p>Many different scholarly communities participated in the diffusion of the Indo-Arabic numerical
                        system from India to Iraq and thence to the African littoral and to Spain. This positional
                        decimal numeral system is the most common symbolic system today for the representation of
                        numbers, and was invented by Indian mathematicians between the 1st and 4th centuries. It reached
                        Baghdad from Persia by 732 A.D., and from there spread to the eastern Mediterranean. Much of
                        this diffusion was carried out by Roman trading vessels moving down the Red Sea from Alexandria
                        to cross the Indian Ocean to trade precious metals for Indian spices. In turn Indian trading
                        vessels made the voyage to Alexandria. After the fall of Egypt in 31 AD to the Roman Empire of
                        Augustus, this trade was accelerated, including over 120 large vessels a year sailing down the
                        Red Sea for Indian and Sri Lankan ports. In this paper, we will note several key features of
                        this trade. First, this enormously large spice trade supported Roman military activity for
                        centuries by means of a value tax at the borders of 25%. Control of Egypt was crucial to this
                        tax. Second, movement of the trade fleets from the Red Sea and returning was based on a careful
                        understanding of seasonal monsoon activity for propulsion. This predictable wind propulsion
                        allowed 6 knots per hour or better. Third, borrowing of numerical systems by Arabic traders
                        while working in India was common but not systematic, as India hosted a multitude of different
                        numerical systems using a different number of digits. Limiting the number of digits to ten as
                        the Indo-Arabic system diffused across the Mediterranean Sea was the last major innovation of
                        the spread of this system and its three variant glyphs.</p>

                                <p>Many different scholarly communities participated in the diffusion of the Indo-Arabic
                                    numerical system from India to Iraq and thence to the African littoral and to Spain.
                                    This positional decimal numeral system is the most common symbolic system today for
                                    the representation of numbers, and was invented by Indian mathematicians between the
                                    1st and 4th centuries. It reached Baghdad from Persia by 732 A.D., and from there
                                    spread to the eastern Mediterranean. </p>
                                <div id='collapse-4' class='collapse'>
                                    <p>Much of this diffusion was carried out by Roman trading vessels moving down the
                                        Red Sea from Alexandria to cross the Indian Ocean to trade precious metals for
                                        Indian spices. In turn Indian trading vessels made the voyage to Alexandria.
                                        After the fall of Egypt in 31 AD to the Roman Empire of Augustus, this trade was
                                        accelerated, including over 120 large vessels a year sailing down the Red Sea
                                        for Indian and Sri Lankan ports. In this paper, we will note several key
                                        features of this trade. First, this enormously large spice trade supported Roman
                                        military activity for centuries by means of a value tax at the borders of 25%.
                                        Control of Egypt was crucial to this tax. Second, movement of the trade fleets
                                        from the Red Sea and returning was based on a careful understanding of seasonal
                                        monsoon activity for propulsion. This predictable wind propulsion allowed 6
                                        knots per hour or better. Third, borrowing of numerical systems by Arabic
                                        traders while working in India was common but not systematic, as India hosted a
                                        multitude of different numerical systems using a different number of digits.
                                        Limiting the number of digits to ten as the Indo-Arabic system diffused across
                                        the Mediterranean Sea was the last major innovation of the spread of this system
                                        and its three variant glyphs. </p>

                    <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid realms
                        pioneered
                        study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises
                        from that era
                        together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and
                        documentary texts
                        from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity
                        was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between
                        scholars affiliated with many
                        different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others.
                        Sometimes this
                        exchange occurred through books or letters while at other times it was face-to-face in formal,
                        institutional settings, side-by-side
                        in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, or family members.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the framework of the project "<a href="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge</a>"
                        (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                        and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of
                        person-to-person knowledge exchange
                        among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.

                    <h3>1. Research Paper Submissions</h3>
                    <p>We'll contact authors of accepted abstracts to set up a date and time that works with
                        your schedule. Sessions will be held in the late fall (October to December). A preliminary
                        draft of your paper for discussion will be uploaded 1–2 weeks before your session to an
                        area where registered participants can read it and ask questions or make comments. During the
                        live session, you'll present a very brief sketch of your results (lightning-talk style),
                        followed by short responses from 1–2 invited participants, and an extended general discussion.
