                        <p>The Buyid Muʿtazilite vizier Ibn ʿAbbād (d. 385/995) famously referred to medicine as ‘a ladder of heresy’ (sullam al-ilḥād). This statement reflects the opinions of a number of Muʿtazilite theologians who, already since the 9th century, polemicised against medicine. These critiques were focused on the epistemological status of a discipline mainly concerned with particulars (juzʾiyyāt), and on the challenge that the Hippocratic-Galenic theories posed for the debates on creation, causation and God’s omnipotence. These theologians did not target a particular religious group but rather those scholars who departed from the consensus about God’s design, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, most especially the group referred to as Dahriyya (Eternalists).
                        </p><p>
                            The suspicion of unbelief –and the shadow of the Dahriyya– never abandoned physicians, but the critique against medicine eventually become a critique of dhimmīs. Medicine had been almost monopolised by Sabians and Christians under the early Abbasids and the Ayyubids, and was largely practiced by Jews in the Fatimid and Mamluk periods. From the 12th/13th century onwards, however, we witness an increasing concern about the confession of physicians that led to the islamisation of this field with the promotion of Muslim medical practitioners and the emergence of the so-called prophetic medicine (ṭibb nabawī).
                        </p><p>
                            Regretfully, Ibn Abī Uṣaybʿia is almost completely silent about all these questions. This ‘Islamisation of medicine’ is perceivable in the increase of Muslim physicians and the references to conversions that appear in the 13th c. biographies of the ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ, but the physician portrayed by this author is a rather idealised image, untainted by these petty polemics. 
                        </p><p>
                            In this paper I will survey a number of sources that offer a rather different glimpse of the role of medicine and dhimmī physicians in pre-Modern Islam. I shall be looking at the way theologians attacked medicine and how it was defended by both Muslim and non-Muslim physicians, sometimes with very similar arguments. I will argue that these polemics cannot be simply subsumed into the dichotomy Islamic/non-Islamic sciences, nor reduced to a clash between Muslim and non-Muslims."</p>

                        The Zoroastrian priesthood was greatly diminished over the centuries after the Arab conquest, and its traditions so scattered that only a fragment of the Zoroastrian knowledge that had once existed still remained by this the ninth century. Yet despite the gap between the Islamic-era priests (mobeds) and the end of the Sasanian kingdom, this corpus of texts is taken to be the product of a continuous tradition of priestly transmission. This paper questions standard narratives of Zoroastrian history, textual transmission, and priestly genealogy by looking at Zoroastrian priests in Arabic sources of the ninth and tenth centuries alongside contemporary Middle Persian texts.
                    </p><p> 
        These references span authors, genres, and centuries of Arabic literature. They appear in histories, geographies, adab works, heresiographies, ṭabaqāt literature, and, of course, Ibn al-Nadīm’s Fihrist. These texts cite the Zoroastrian priests of the ʿAbbāsid era (usually al-mawbaḏ in Arabic) as authors of books, informants on topics of Persian religious or cultural significance, sages attributed with wise or clever sayings, advisors to kings and caliphs, and participants in religious debates in the court of the caliph or his vizier. Sometimes the reference is to a named individual—and in a few instances this name is corroborated by Zoroastrian texts. 
    </p><p> 
        There were evidently more mobeds than previously assumed from Zoroastrian texts alone, and they were active in the wider intellectual circles and operating under the patronage of Muslim rulers. There were multiple communities of Zoroastrians living under Islamic rule, and it is not clear to what extent they communicated with each other or followed similar practices. Arabic sources from the period can shed light on where and when these communities thrived, what groups and individuals were considered authoritative in the wider Zoroastrian community, and what regional variety there might also have been—rather than assuming a narrative of orthodox transmission.

                        <p>Many different scholarly communities participated in the diffusion of the Indo-Arabic numerical system from India to Iraq and thence to the African littoral and to Spain. This positional decimal numeral system is the most common symbolic system today for the representation of numbers, and was invented by Indian mathematicians between the 1st and 4th centuries. It reached Baghdad from Persia by 732 A.D., and from there spread to the eastern Mediterranean. Much of this diffusion was carried out by Roman trading vessels moving down the Red Sea from Alexandria to cross the Indian Ocean to trade precious metals for Indian spices. In turn Indian trading vessels made the voyage to Alexandria. After the fall of Egypt in 31 AD to the Roman Empire of Augustus, this trade was accelerated, including over 120 large vessels a year sailing down the Red Sea for Indian and Sri Lankan ports. In this paper, we will note several key features of this trade. First, this enormously large spice trade supported Roman military activity for centuries by means of a value tax at the borders of 25%. Control of Egypt was crucial to this tax. Second, movement of the trade fleets from the Red Sea and returning was based on a careful understanding of seasonal monsoon activity for propulsion. This predictable wind propulsion allowed 6 knots per hour or better. Third, borrowing of numerical systems by Arabic traders while working in India was common but not systematic, as India hosted a multitude of different numerical systems using a different number of digits. Limiting the number of digits to ten as the Indo-Arabic system diffused across the Mediterranean Sea was the last major innovation of the spread of this system and its three variant glyphs.</p><p>

                        <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid realms pioneered 
                            study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises from that era 
                            together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and documentary texts 
                            from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity 
                            was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between scholars affiliated with many 
                            different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others. Sometimes this 
                            exchange occurred through books or letters while at other times it was face-to-face in formal, institutional settings, side-by-side 
                            in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, or family members. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>In the framework of the project "<a href="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge</a>" (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                        and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of person-to-person knowledge exchange
                        among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <b>keynote</b> session will feature <b>Dr. Ignacio Sánchez</b> (University of Warwick), whose recent contributions to the field include helping to prepare a brand new edition and translation of Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, <a href="https://dh.brill.com/scholarlyeditions/library/urn:cts:arabicLit:0668IbnAbiUsaibia/"><i>The Best Accounts of the Classes of Physicians</i></a> (Leiden: Brill, 2020).</p>

                        <p>The series is open to two types of submissions: <b>research papers</b> and <b>project demos</b>.</p>
                        <h3>1. Research Paper Submissions</h3>
                        <p>We'll contact authors of accepted abstracts to set up a date and time that works with 
                            your schedule. Sessions will be held in the late fall (October to December). A preliminary 
                            draft of your paper for discussion will be uploaded 1–2 weeks before your session to an 
                            area where registered participants can read it and ask questions or make comments. During the 
                            live session, you'll present a very brief sketch of your results (lightning-talk style), 
                            followed by short responses from 1–2 invited participants, and an extended general discussion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Revised papers will be submitted in 2021 to <b>a special issue of <a href="http://www.medievalworlds.net"><i>medieval worlds: comparative &amp; interdisciplinary studies</i></a></b>, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ISSN 2412-3196). Per the journal guidelines, research articles should be 5,000–10,000 words.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Project Demos</h3>
                        <p>Accepted project demos will be scheduled according to the author's convenience and included as brief presentations during one of the relevant live discussions. Project demos will also be submitted as short articles (2,000–5,000 words) to the forum's special issue of <a href="http://www.medievalworlds.net"><i>medieval worlds: comparative &amp; interdisciplinary studies</i></a>.</p>
