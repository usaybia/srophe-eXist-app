                            <p>The Buyid Muʿtazilite vizier Ibn ʿAbbād (d. 385/995) famously referred to medicine as ‘a
                                ladder of heresy’ (sullam al-ilḥād). This statement reflects the opinions of a number of
                                Muʿtazilite theologians who, already since the 9th century, polemicised against
                                medicine. These critiques were focused on the epistemological status of a discipline
                                mainly concerned with particulars (juzʾiyyāt), and on the challenge that the
                                Hippocratic-Galenic theories posed for the debates on creation, causation and God’s
                                omnipotence. These theologians did not target a particular religious group but rather
                                those scholars who departed from the consensus about God’s design, Muslims and
                                non-Muslims alike, most especially the group referred to as Dahriyya (Eternalists).

                            <div id="collapse-2" class="collapse">
                                <p>
                                    The suspicion of unbelief –and the shadow of the Dahriyya– never abandoned
                                    physicians, but the critique against medicine eventually become a critique of
                                    dhimmīs. Medicine had been almost monopolised by Sabians and Christians under the
                                    early Abbasids and the Ayyubids, and was largely practiced by Jews in the Fatimid
                                    and Mamluk periods. From the 12th/13th century onwards, however, we witness an
                                    increasing concern about the confession of physicians that led to the islamisation
                                    of this field with the promotion of Muslim medical practitioners and the emergence
                                    of the so-called prophetic medicine (ṭibb nabawī).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regretfully, Ibn Abī Uṣaybʿia is almost completely silent about all these questions.
                                    This ‘Islamisation of medicine’ is perceivable in the increase of Muslim physicians
                                    and the references to conversions that appear in the 13th c. biographies of the
                                    ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ, but the physician portrayed by this author is a rather idealised
                                    image, untainted by these petty polemics.
                                </p>

                                    In this paper I will survey a number of sources that offer a rather different
                                    glimpse of the role of medicine and dhimmī physicians in pre-Modern Islam. I shall
                                    be looking at the way theologians attacked medicine and how it was defended by both
                                    Muslim and non-Muslim physicians, sometimes with very similar arguments. I will
                                    argue that these polemics cannot be simply subsumed into the dichotomy
                                    Islamic/non-Islamic sciences, nor reduced to a clash between Muslim and
                                    non-Muslims."</p>

                    The Zoroastrian priesthood was greatly diminished over the centuries after the Arab conquest, and
                    its traditions so scattered that only a fragment of the Zoroastrian knowledge that had once existed
                    still remained by this the ninth century. Yet despite the gap between the Islamic-era priests
                    (mobeds) and the end of the Sasanian kingdom, this corpus of texts is taken to be the product of a
                    continuous tradition of priestly transmission. This paper questions standard narratives of
                    Zoroastrian history, textual transmission, and priestly genealogy by looking at Zoroastrian priests
                    in Arabic sources of the ninth and tenth centuries alongside contemporary Middle Persian texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These references span authors, genres, and centuries of Arabic literature. They appear in
                        histories, geographies, adab works, heresiographies, ṭabaqāt literature, and, of course, Ibn
                        al-Nadīm’s Fihrist. These texts cite the Zoroastrian priests of the ʿAbbāsid era (usually
                        al-mawbaḏ in Arabic) as authors of books, informants on topics of Persian religious or cultural
                        significance, sages attributed with wise or clever sayings, advisors to kings and caliphs, and
                        participants in religious debates in the court of the caliph or his vizier. Sometimes the
                        reference is to a named individual—and in a few instances this name is corroborated by
                        Zoroastrian texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were evidently more mobeds than previously assumed from Zoroastrian texts alone, and they
                        were active in the wider intellectual circles and operating under the patronage of Muslim
                        rulers. There were multiple communities of Zoroastrians living under Islamic rule, and it is not
                        clear to what extent they communicated with each other or followed similar practices. Arabic
                        sources from the period can shed light on where and when these communities thrived, what groups
                        and individuals were considered authoritative in the wider Zoroastrian community, and what
                        regional variety there might also have been—rather than assuming a narrative of orthodox
                        transmission.

                    <p>Many different scholarly communities participated in the diffusion of the Indo-Arabic numerical
                        system from India to Iraq and thence to the African littoral and to Spain. This positional
                        decimal numeral system is the most common symbolic system today for the representation of
                        numbers, and was invented by Indian mathematicians between the 1st and 4th centuries. It reached
                        Baghdad from Persia by 732 A.D., and from there spread to the eastern Mediterranean. Much of
                        this diffusion was carried out by Roman trading vessels moving down the Red Sea from Alexandria
                        to cross the Indian Ocean to trade precious metals for Indian spices. In turn Indian trading
                        vessels made the voyage to Alexandria. After the fall of Egypt in 31 AD to the Roman Empire of
                        Augustus, this trade was accelerated, including over 120 large vessels a year sailing down the
                        Red Sea for Indian and Sri Lankan ports. In this paper, we will note several key features of
                        this trade. First, this enormously large spice trade supported Roman military activity for
                        centuries by means of a value tax at the borders of 25%. Control of Egypt was crucial to this
                        tax. Second, movement of the trade fleets from the Red Sea and returning was based on a careful
                        understanding of seasonal monsoon activity for propulsion. This predictable wind propulsion
                        allowed 6 knots per hour or better. Third, borrowing of numerical systems by Arabic traders
                        while working in India was common but not systematic, as India hosted a multitude of different
                        numerical systems using a different number of digits. Limiting the number of digits to ten as
                        the Indo-Arabic system diffused across the Mediterranean Sea was the last major innovation of
                        the spread of this system and its three variant glyphs.</p>

<p>This paper is focused on the study of an unpublished palimpsest fragment from the Qubbat al-khazna in Damascus, which presents a very interesting structure. The Greek scriptio inferior, already identified as a biblical text, coexists with the Arabic scriptio superior − referred to an Islamic text − which has not been properly studied in its textual and paleographical features so far. The Arabic text is an excerpt belonging to the medical-botanical work entitled Mukhtaṣar fī-l- ṭibb (“Compendium of medicine”) − known from only one manuscript witness so far − written by the Andalusian jurist ‛Abd al-Malik b.

<div id='collapse-5' class='collapse'><p>The textual examination of the Arabic text will be conducted along with the paleographical and codicological analysis of the fragment, in order to suggest some hypotheses about its dating and provenance. Such a multidisciplinary research represents a starting point from which some thoughts, referred to the Arabic scriptio superior in the first place, has been carried out. For example, the study of the Arabic text − which testifies a high degree of knowledge in the fields of botany and medicine − along with the palimpsest order of the fragment, has suggested a monastic environment as its probable place of origin. Furthermore, the fragment represents a documentary witness which highlights the relevance of the body care, as attributed in such environment, in addition to the peculiar process of the discard of a religious text − the Bible in Greek − apparently sensed as no more useful, in a context arguably yet arabized. More interestingly, it is a clear evidence of the fact that such a vision of life was pursued acquiring ideas and concepts, also derived from different cultures − even if it would have implied the study and the use of an Islamic text, written in the Arabic script.</p>

<p>An Arabic commentary on Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, Sefer ha-Maddaʿ, Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah I–IV, attributed to a Ḥanafī muwaqqit in late 14th century Aleppo, has attracted the attention of many distinguished scholars over the last century and a half. The research history of this significant document is almost as intriguing as the text itself and attests to the difficulty of 19th and 20th century scholarship to come to terms with the peculiar setting of a Muslim scholar commenting on a Jewish halakhic treatise.</p>
<div id='collapse-6' class='collapse'><p>In my presentation, I will briefly summarise the research history to illustrate how historiography is prone to be (mis-)guided by cultural predispositions and shaped by issues, concerns, and blind spots rooted in the historian’s realm of experience.</p>
<p>The commentary by ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Ṭaybughā was the result of a longstanding friendship with Rabbi David ben Yehoshuʿa, the grandson of Maimonides’ great-grandson. The impact of this friendship comes to the fore on several occasions in David’s own commentary on the Mishneh Torah. In David’s view, this friendship represented far more than a mere social acquaintance with a Muslim soulmate. Like his illustrious ancestor, he conceived of the Foundational Laws of the Torah as a straightforward, ‘exoteric’ digest of all theoretical sciences, in such a way that a well-conceived commentary upon these chapters should build upon the most advanced scientific knowledge available at a given time. The perfect commentator should therefore be a leading scientist of his time, irrespective of his religious affiliation.</p>

<p>Barhebraeus, the great Syrian Orthodox polymath and theologian (1226-1286), treats animals’ abilities to sleep and dream in his inedited Book on Animals of his philosophical summa Cream of Wisdom, a book that draws heavily on Avicenna, though also on Aristotle.</p>
<p>In comparison with his sources, however, he might be understood as allowing for more animals to have the ability to dream than Aristotle initially did, even though using Aristotle’s animal examples for viviparous quadrupeds, the primary group of animals able to dream for Aristotle.</p>
<div id='collapse-7' class='collapse'><p>The paper will, firstly, address the question which groups of animals are considered as being able to dream according to Aristotle, Avicenna, Barhebraeus, Albert the Great in the Latin West, who was also in particular influenced by Avicenna, as well as the Iraqi zoologist Ibn Abī al-Ashʿath, who stood more in the Galenic than Aristotelian tradition, and point to changes and ask whether these changes were intentional or just due to paraphrasing a given source.</p>
<p>Secondly, the paper will address the question which sources Barhebraeus had at his disposal and where. Though witnessing the very end of the Abbasid era, he still benefitted from translations begun during the early Abbasids. Especially the early combined Arabic transmission of three Aristotelian zoological works still had an impact on his Syriac Book on Animals.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the question of collaborating with other scholars shall be addressed, though this has to be done ex negativo for the composition of the Animals. While Barhebraeus is assumed to have met, for example, the Muslim scholar Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī in person at the Maragha observatory and academy, which had an influence on his astronomical works, and also a personal acquaintance with Ibn Kammūna, a philosopher of Jewish descent, has recently been assumed by Roggema regarding theological texts,  this form of cooperation surprisingly doesn’t seem to be the case for his biological works, where he primarily relies on Aristotle and Avicenna. The paper will look into the reasons for that and argue tentatively that this assumed lack of a manifestation of a knowledge transfer by personal exchange in his biological works, in contrast to other works by him, might here be due to a neglect of zoological topics or a changed curriculum in post-classical Islamic philosophy, and that this lack of contemporary or at least post-Avicennan available texts led him to take recourse to Aristotle and Avicenna instead. </p>

<p>The early ʻAbbasid epoch was famous for adaptation of Greek science through the intellectual work of Syrian scholars. The Nestorian center of learning and intellectual work, the monastery Dayr Qunnā near Baghdad had a special patronage. In the ʻAbbasid epoch this center trained personnel for the state administration. The most eminent figure in Islamic tradition, who probably was influenced by Dayr Qunna, was the eminent Baghdad Sufi master al-Ḥallāj. Some researchers even found him a hidden Christian. </p>
<div id='collapse-8' class='collapse'><p>Really some points of al-Ḥallāj’s teaching about divine love, annihilation of human spirit in God and incarnation (ḥulūl) of the divine nature (lāhūt) in the human nature (nāsūt), and unity with God (ittiḥād) have clear parallels with Syrian Christianity. His cosmological doctrine has a number of parallels with ideas of pseudo-Empedocles that gained popularity in Syrian monasteries. The crucial al-Ḥallāj’s cosmological points were promoted by Abū ’l-Ḥasan ʻAlī al-Daylamī in the Kitāb ‘aṭf al-alif al-ma’lūf ‘alā l-lām al-ma‘ṭūf. Al-Daylamī was a disciple of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī and belonged to the tradition cultivated the cosmological ideas of pseudo-Empedocles. In ‘Abbasid epoch this tradition comes from Dayr Qunnā. The Comment to Aristotle's Metaphysics written by Mattā b. Yūnus, the eminent representative of the local scientific tradition shows this tendency. We can reconstruct the crucial points of the Arab partisans of pseudo-Empedocles according to several texts of al-Shahrastānī, Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, al-Daylamī and al-Ḥallāj. For example, the presence of five emanations and four elements which are moved by love and hostility; the passionate love as the most important divine attribute. The materia prima appeared through this attribute. </p>

<p>Library records and manuscript catalogues are fundamental sources for historians, nevertheless, researchers are aware that a ​transmission process is determined by both the extant manuscripts as well as by a great number of texts which were lost in time. Historians of German literature claim that for every preserved work there are thousands of lost ones. While it is difficult to appreciate the number of lost sources, it is vital to consider the untransferred and lost knowledge in order to understand the exchange of ideas within a community.</p>

An analysis of networks evolving around the lost works will be backed up with further resources and literature.

<p>Ibn al-Nadīm’s Fihrist is a major primary source for the Abbasid intellectual history. Although its importance for the field has been acknowledged since its first edition at the end of the 19th century, the studies dealing with this encyclopaedic work as a whole are remarkably rare, since its material has been mostly used by researchers looking for biographic details regarding specific scholars of the Islamic Middle Ages.</p>
<p>        </p>
<div id='collapse-10' class='collapse'><p>Our intent is to approach the Fihrist as a coherent totality, taking into account the overarching structure of the text and the repeating patterns from one section to another, and to assess its treatment of interreligious scholarly collaboration through a systematic survey of the relevant instances. Since Ibn al-Nadīm (d. 330/990) gathered pieces of information about a wide range of scholars, it is very interesting to examine the ways in which he depicts the cases of interaction – and sometimes conflict – between Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars. It is particularly important when it comes to specialists of rational sciences, as it is well-known that certain fields such as medicine, astronomy and philosophy involved scholars from different religious backgrounds in Abbasid and Buyid centres of knowledge, especially in the context of translation activities.</p>
<p>        Three main lines of inquiry will guide our presentation. First, the forms, times and places of interreligious exchanges in the Fihrist. Then, the position of the author regarding this phenomenon: does he explicitly acknowledge it or does he merely mention it without labelling it? Lastly, since these collaborations mainly appear in the context of anecdotes, how can we interpret these narratives, and use them to improve our understanding of the social and religious dynamics of the Abbasid scholarly milieu? Our hope is that by focusing on the general structure of this work, we will shed a new light on the problematic of interreligious collaboration in the Abbasid society, as well as lay the ground for drawing parallels with Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa’s ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ in that respect.</p>

<p>Islamic medicine certainly inherited a refined tradition from Greek medicine, but also has seen an important shift in medical training. First, the structures radically changed: they went from an era where medicine passed on from father to son, or where being the disciple of a master was very much like becoming part of his family---to an era where several types of medical training coexisted: from father to son, by teaching oneself (viz. by reading handbooks) or by resorting to the master through classes in hospitals or medical schools. </p>
<div id='collapse-12' class='collapse'><p>Obviously, the first two ways must be taken into consideration for approaching properly how the sources spread into the Arabic world and how they were handled by scholars, many of them were travellers and collectors of books. Nevertheless, the latter, to which one must add discussions between trained physicians, gives us a lively and vivid insight into the way Arabic medicine evolved through debates between prominent figures.</p>
<p>In this respect, in connection with the transmission of medical art and the handbooks, of great interest are the issues related to the religious affiliation of the physicians, either Christians, Jews or Mulsims, at the turning point between the Ayyūbid and the Mamlūk eras (in the XIII^th^ century AD.) between Damascus and Cairo, for they all did refer to Greek sources, but in different ways. On this account, of particular interest are the literary patterns that are used to put on stage these controversies as they may rely on traditions already found centuries ago, in authors such as al-Jāḥiẓ or al-Tawḥīdī.</p>
<p>We will try to explore the most significant examples provided by Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah, some of which deal with teaching, others with research, showing active discussions between physicians, regardless of religion, facilitated by the sultan himself who provided a special place at his residence to be used as a *majlis* for research. Surely, depending on whether they were Muslims, Jews or Christians, the social positions they held were different, but also complementary as they had different access to the sources. Even the most prominent Mulsim physicians had to rely on colleagues who could recall Galenic sources word for word. This point explains to a large extent the faithfulness of the text preserved in Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿah to the Greek sources.</p>

<p>Timothy I (ca. 740-823 CE/AH 122-208) was katholikos of the Church of the East for more than forty years between the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th century (ca. 780-823/AH 164-208). During this time, he moved the seat of the patriarchate to Baghdad, where he entertained close relationships with the Abbasid court. A number of his surviving letters, written in Syriac, attest to this. In particular, two letter-treatises of considerable length relate encounters Timothy had with a Muslim Aristotelian philosopher (letter 40) and with caliph Al Mahdi himself (letter 59). </p>
<div id='collapse-13' class='collapse'><p>These letters document an intense theological debate that took place between Christians and Muslims at the court, one that used Aristotelian logic as a sort of shared language in order to discuss urgent religious and philosophical matters. While scholars have paid much attention to this material, there remains to be studied how Timothy modulated his explanations according to the intended audience. My paper aims to analyse how Timothy managed to express his beliefs in different ways depending on different occasions. Far from being a faithful reflection of the dialogues that took place at the caliph’s court, I maintain that Timothy’s letters are carefully planned literary products that served a double purpose. On the one hand, they conveyed a climate of peaceful and productive exchange with Muslim scholars and sovereigns, but on the other, they played the crucial role of providing other Christians with a ready-made set of answers to some of the thorniest questions and objections that their Muslim counterparts could pose to them. By extending the view to those letters (esp. 34-6) that were aimed solely at an internal, Christian audience, I will show how this process of reader-oriented variation occurred and I will attempt to reconstruct Timothy’s preoccupations as Head of the eastern Church.</p>

<p>The paper analyzes theological texts by Patriarch Timothy I (letters 40 and 59) and Nonnus of Nisibis (“The Apologetic Treatise”) written in Syriac during the 8th and 9th centuries. These Christian authors aimed to defend their Christian faith against Muslim objections against Christianity. In doing so, Timothy and Nonnus seemed to be well aware of the Islamic theology of their period. The paper compares Timothy’s and Nonnus’ reasoning to defend the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and Christology with contemporary Muslim (especially Muʿtazilite) thought. </p>
<div id='collapse-14' class='collapse'><p>Although the textual material of the Muʿtazilite thinkers from the 8th and 9th centuries which has come down to us is rather scanty, it is possible to identify references to certain Muʿtazilite thinkers or to particular Muslim doctrines in the texts written by Timothy and Nonnus. The paper outlines these references to contemporary Muslim thought in more detail than previous research has done. Thus, it demonstrates that Christians and Muslims were not just religious counterparts during the ʿAbbāsid period. Instead, even religious disputation texts show that its Christian authors had an intimate knowledge of the Muslim theology of their period and must have been in close contact with their Muslim colleagues.</p>

<p>The 7th-century Arab Muslim conquests changed the socio-political configurations in the Mediterranean and Eurasia forever. Yet we do not really know how the Arabs managed to gain dominance of this vast, ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse area which had its own, long imperial traditions, and to make this a sustainable enterprise. What built the empire, and what held it together?</p>
<div id='collapse-15' class='collapse'><p>Embedding Conquest" investigates the mechanics and structures of social, economic and personal dependency that tied the diverse regions of the early Islamic empire together, from the Nile Delta to the Hindu Kush. We approach this broad question as a team by examining a vast corpus of documentary letters written on papyrus, paper, potsherds, and other materials, as well as letters reproduced in literary sources. In our demo, we will present some of our most salient preliminary findings. We will focus on the elements of our research that best highlight the coparticipation of religious leaders and religious agents from different groups, environments, and communities.</p>
<p>The project studies the mechanics of Islamic rule through three main areas: the language of social dependency expressed, in particular, in letters of request; the relationship between central and provincial governorship; and the role of local elites as well as actors at the fringes of government, such as religious scholars, among others. Our research is comparative, as it embraces local realities in different regions and looks at a variety of groups, not to mention sources in several languages and scripts; attentive to trends and trajectories, as it covers over three centuries; and innovative, as it is based on most recent findings in papyrology and archaeology, combining them with new perspectives in Middle East history. For the virtual forum on "Jews, Christians, and Muslims as Colleagues and Collaborators in the Abbasid Near East" we would like to briefly present the research of two team members in particular, the project's postdoctoral fellows Ed Hayes and Cecilia Palombo, who have been working on the intersection of religious leadership and political governance. Ed Hayes' research focuses on the history of early Imami Shi'i communities and on the relationship between fiscal policy and religious protest. Cecilia Palombo's research, on the other hand, looks at the development of localized forms of Islamic governance through the involvement of Christian religious leaders, such as monastic headmen.</p>
<p>We hope to take the opportunity of this Forum for sharing some of our insights concerning the role of religious leaders from different communities in shaping and establishing early Islamic rule; and concerning the way in which those leaders' political activities, at the same time, contributed to shape religious knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>The term ḥanpā (pl. ḥanpē), Syriac ‘pagan,’ was used by Syriac Christian scholars to denote a variety of non-Christian religious communities and was one of the first Syriac terms used to refer to Muslims. While other Syriac terms came into use to denote Muslims over the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, C.E., ḥanpā remained common well into the ‘Abbasid period, especially in legal writing. This paper focuses on the use of ḥanpā/ḥanpē in Syriac Christian legal writing in the early ‘Abbasid period to signify Muslims. </p>
<div id='collapse-16' class='collapse'><p>In this paper, I argue that, when used in Syriac Christian legal texts, the term ḥanpā should be viewed as a legal category, one that very much included Muslims. In this context, a ḥanpā is essentially an outsider who may still interact with Syriac Christian individuals and communities, but in an increasingly regulated way that is meant to protect Syriac Christian communities from loss of constituents (presumably to conversion to Islam) or the blurring of boundaries between Muslim and Christian beliefs and practices. For example, marrying one’s daughter to a pagan was condemned in the canons of George I of Antioch (d. 790 C.E.), and marrying a daughter to a ḥanpā barred father and daughter from entering the church.  It is clear this ruling included Muslim men, or perhaps was specifically meant for them. In contrast, earlier Syriac Christian leaders such as Jacob of Edessa (d. 708 C.E.) allowed Christian women who married Muslim men to continue taking communion, on grounds that not allowing them to do so would encourage conversion to Islam.  Use of ḥanpā to describe Muslims in the early ‘Abbasid era suggests an attempt to regulate interactions with Muslims, with a particular emphasis on marriage, conversion, and social interactions.</p>

                    <p>From the eighth century to the thirteenth century and beyond, scholars in the Abbasid realms
                        pioneered
                        study in medicine, mathematics, the astral arts, and many other disciplines. Scholarly treatises
                        from that era
                        together with biographical sources such as Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's <i>History of Physicians</i> and
                        documentary texts
                        from the Cairo Genizah show that this scholarly activity
                        was not isolated to a single community. Instead, it emerged from a rich exchange between
                        scholars affiliated with many
                        different communities: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Samaritan, and others.
                        Sometimes this
                        exchange occurred through books or letters while at other times it was face-to-face in formal,
                        institutional settings, side-by-side
                        in the workplace, or even mediated through patrons, servants, or family members.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the framework of the project "<a href="https://usaybia.net">Communities of Knowledge</a>"
                        (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
                        and Research), we invite contributions to a series of discussions on the topic of
                        person-to-person knowledge exchange
                        among Near Eastern communities during Abbasid rule.

                    <h3>1. Research Paper Submissions</h3>
                    <p>We'll contact authors of accepted abstracts to set up a date and time that works with
                        your schedule. Sessions will be held in the late fall (October to December). A preliminary
                        draft of your paper for discussion will be uploaded 1–2 weeks before your session to an
                        area where registered participants can read it and ask questions or make comments. During the
                        live session, you'll present a very brief sketch of your results (lightning-talk style),
                        followed by short responses from 1–2 invited participants, and an extended general discussion.
