  This release is intended for testing the web application used on the [Usaybia.net](https://usaybia.net) website. 

  It is intended to be used with data from the [usaybia-data repository](https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data).

  The .xar package should be installed in [eXist-db 5.x](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html). 

  You can also make your own .xar of the application by downloading this repo and running ant in the repo directory.
